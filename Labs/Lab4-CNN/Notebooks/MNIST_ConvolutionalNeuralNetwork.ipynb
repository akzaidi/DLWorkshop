    "## Overview of convolutional neural networks\n",
    "A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. The CNNs take advantage of the spatial nature of the data. In nature, we perceive different objects by their shapes, size and colors. For example, objects in a natural scene are typically edges, corners/vertices (defined by two of more edges), color patches etc. These primitives are often identified using different detectors (e.g., edge detection, color detector) or combination of detectors interacting to facilitate image interpretation (object classification, region of interest detection, scene description etc.) in real world vision related tasks. These detectors are also known as filters. Convolution is a mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (representing say egdges, corners, colors etc in the input image).  Historically, these filters are a set of weights that were often hand crafted or modeled with mathematical functions (e.g., [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) / [Laplacian](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm) / [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filter).  The filter outputs are mapped through non-linear activation functions mimicking human brain cells called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional networks provide a machinery to learn these filters from the data directly instead of explicit mathematical models and have been found to be superior (in real world tasks) compared to historically crafted filters.  With convolutional networks, the focus is on learning the filter weights instead of learning individually fully connected pair-wise (between inputs and outputs) weights. In this way, the number of weights to learn is reduced when compared with the traditional MLP networks from the previous tutorials.  In a convolutional network, one learns several filters ranging from few single digits to few thousands depending on the network complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the CNN primitives have been shown to have a conceptually parallel components in brain's [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex). The group of neurons cells in visual cortex emit responses when stimulated. This region is known as the receptive field (RF). Equivalently, in convolution the input region corresponding to the filter dimensions can be considered as the receptive field. Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology).  \n"

    "CNN is a feedforward network made up of bunch of layers in such a way that the output of one layer becomes the input to the next layer (similar to MLP). In MLP, all possible pairs of input pixels are connected to the output nodes with each pair having a weight, thus leading to a combinatorial explosion of parameters to be learnt and also increasing the possibility of overfitting ([details](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/)). Convolution layers take advantage of the spatial arrangement of the pixels and learn multiple filters that significantly reduce the amount of parameters in the network ([details](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)). The size of the filter is a parameter of the convolution layer.  \n",

Each convolution layer has a parameter to specify the `filter_shape`, specifying the width and height of the filter in case most natural scene images.  There is a parameter (`strides`) that controls the how far to step to right when moving the filters through multiple RF's in a row, and how far to step down when moving to the next row.  The boolean parameter `pad` controls if the input should be padded around the edges to allow a complete tiling of the RF's near the borders. \n",

We have seen this before with Logistic Regression and MLP where features were mapped to the number of classes in the final layer.

The maximum value within the window becomes the output of the region.
